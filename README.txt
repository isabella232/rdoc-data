= rdoc-data

* http://rdoc.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

Core ri data for use with RDoc 2.5 or newer.  This gem is required to use ri
from RDoc 2.5 and newer with Ruby 1.8.7.  ri data for Ruby 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 are
also included for use with JRuby but are not needed for typical installs of C
Ruby.

== FEATURES:

* Core ri data for use with rdoc >= 2.5
* Core ri data for rdoc <= 2.4.3 will still work (if you uninstall 2.5+)
* Does not update ri data for gems (use gem rdoc --all --overwrite --no-rdoc)
* Contains ri data for ruby versions 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3 built from ruby
  releases 1.8.7-p358, 1.9.2-p290 and 1.9.3-p125 respectively.
